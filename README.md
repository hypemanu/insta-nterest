# INSTA-NTEREST
This is a long thread of favourite Instagram accounts. I will be updating the list as I please.
## Detail
Instagram is a social networking app made for sharing photos and videos from a smartphone.
Similar to Facebook or Twitter, everyone who creates an Instagram account has a profile and a news feed.
When you post a photo or video on Instagram, it will be displayed on your profile. Source: [Livewire](https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-instagram-3486316)
